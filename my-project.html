                    <p>In my first project I will tell you about my trip to Norway. Me and my sisters
                        went to Norway to earn some money at picking strawberries. We lived in a village
                        named Haukasen, it was 5km from the nearest city. We lived at our employer place in
                        one room. During this month we went for some field trips and also did some sightseeing
                        of Oslo city.</p>

                    <p>In my second project I will tell you about my trip to Sweden. Me and my friend Maciej
                        went to Sweden to earn some money at working in a construction company of his fathers.
                        We painted houses of some friends of Maciej's father in Stockholm. Basically we worked
                        in detached houses but one time we had to repair the roof in the twin house. At weekends
                        we were trying to see some new things, so we travelled by car to new places, basically
                        we wanted to do nature exploration so we saw a lot of lakes placed in forests. We worked
                        for 1.5 month and then returned to Poland.</p>

                    <h2>My third project</h2>
                    <p>In my third project I will tell you about my trip to Netherlands. Me and my friend Michał
                        went to Netherlands to earn money at orderpicking for Alberhein Company. We were collecting
                        orders in storehouses for individual Alberhein markets. We lived in the Haag city really
                        close to the sea. We were here for 2 months living at his sister's place. In free time we
                        focused to see as many places as we could. It was easy to achieve because I had my own
                        car which we used for travelling across the Netherlands. We were sightseeing Amsterdam,
                        Rotterdam, we also went to some villages and National Parks.
                        I had a really good time here.</p>
