                <h2>My first project</h2>
                <p>In my first project I will tell you about my trip to Norway. Me and my sisters 
                    went to Norway to earn some money at picking strawberries. We lived in a village
                named Haukasen, it was 5km from the nearest city. We lived at our employer place in 
                one room. During this month we went for some field trips and also did some sightseeing
            of Oslo city.</p>

                <h2>My second project</h2>
                <p>In my second project I will tell you about my trip to Sweden. Me and my friend Maciej
                   went to Sweden to earn some money at working in a construction company of his fathers.
                   We painted houses of some friends of Maciej's father in Stockholm. Basically we worked
                   in detached houses but one time we had to repair the roof in the twin house. At weekends
                   we were trying to see some new things, so we travelled by car to new places, basically
                   we wanted to do nature exploration so we saw a lot of lakes placed in forests. We worked
                   for 1.5 month and then returned to Poland.</p>

                <h2>My third project</h2>
                <p>In my third project I will tell you about my trip to Netherlands. Me and my friend Micha≈Ç
                    went to Netherlands to earn money at orderpicking for Alberhein Company. We were collecting
                    orders in storehouses for individual Alberhein markets. We lived in the Haag city really
                    close to the sea. We were here for 2 months living at his sister's place. In free time we
                    focused to see as many places as we could. It was easy to achieve because I had my own
                    car which we used for travelling across the Netherlands. We were sightseeing Amsterdam,
                    Rotterdam, we also went to some villages and National Parks. 
                    It had a really good time here.</p>
